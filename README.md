I developed a full stack web application called ITOOLS for Innova Service Delivery Unit all by myself. I did everything from scratch. By saying scratch I mean from designing pages in Figma all the way up to the deployment and maintenance. I used React for the frontend side, Express.js(Nodejs) for the backend side. I also used the SQL server as a database and IIS for the deployment process. ITOOLS has been in use since January 2023. It has over 100 users and most of them are using the system daily.

## Accomplished ...
The development of ITOOLS streamlined the entire process of managing subcontractor progress payments, ensuring that all calculations are accurately performed and that subcontractors receive their payments without issues. Additionally, all payments to subcontractors are processed through ITOOLS, enabling comprehensive tracking of all work and progress payments.

## By Implementing ...
Using React for the frontend and Express.js (Node.js) for the backend, the project was built from scratch, starting with page designs in Figma. SQL Server was utilized for data management, and IIS was chosen for deployment. The application supports multiple user roles, each with specific access levels, to ensure a controlled and secure workflow.

## Which Led to ...
These implementations led to a more organized and efficient process for handling subcontractor payments. Before ITOOLS, there was no tracking system in place, which often resulted in delays and errors. Since its deployment in January 2023, the system has gained over 100 daily active users, drastically improving the management and accuracy of progress payments.

# What is - [Itools](https://www.itoolsinnova.com/) ? 


  Itools is a full stack website which provides subcontractors to get their progress payments about work they have made. Also Itools securely stores all records to serve later to the service delivery unit because before Itools there was no tracking system.

  Itools has 5 main roles which are admin, subcontractor management unit, project manager, subcontractor and dispatcher. These roles can perform actions through Itools according to their access level. Simply the process begins with the project manager. S/he creates a contract request from their ui and then the subcontractor management unit approves or declines it. If the unit declines it then the project manager can reorganize the contract and send them back. All decline mechanisms through Itools gives users the opportunity to reorganize and send back to the next step which is a related unit or person.

  After the contract approval the project manager creates his/her project and creates works connected to this project and sends them to the subcontractor management unit for approval. Subcontractor management unit selects a subcontractor which is appropriate to that specific work. After that, approve the work request and send them to the project manager orientation phase. At this specific phase the project manager selects the appropriate time span for this work and approves it. When the project manager approves the work it goes to the subcontractor assigned works phase. At this step the subcontractor decides whether s/he does it or not. If work is not suitable for the subcontractor then the subcontractor can send a rejection request. If everything goes on then the subcontractor accepts the work and does it on the field.

  After the subcontractor is done with the work s/he logs in the system again and goes to the send progress payment page. In this page the subcontractor enters all their works like I used 100 meters of cable according to the given product set etc. The product set comes from the first step by the way. While the project manager creates a contract s/he creates products according to the contract. The system automatically binds them together and shows the subcontractor only the products that the contract includes in the send progress payment page. So after the subcontractor enters all his/her products, s/he uploads the acceptance report to the system and sends it to the subcontractor management unit.

  The unit checks whether it is correct or not by comparing acceptance reports and the products. Then the unit approves it if there is no problem and sends it to the project manager single progress payment control page. S/he checks himself/herself as well before the works turn into term progress payments. S/he approves it and sends it to subcontractor management unit’s waiting for the term progress payments page. At this step subcontractor management unit brings all works together by selecting project and subcontractor. The unit selects subcontractor and project and system automatically lists all works according to project and subcontractor. Then the unit selects among works to move on and the system calculates the total progress payments.

  After that unit selects the term for the progress payment by selecting month and year and sends it to the project manager. Project manager checks again and the system creates an excel file that includes all products and works belonging to the project and subcontractor. S/he downloads the excel file and sends it to the company’s purchasing unit for the payment process. The main process is done with the last step. Itools also includes the company progress payment phase. After the first phase is done Project managers can also combine term progress payments to get company’s progress payments from the parent company. It has other small mechanisms but mainly the process works like above. You can check the manuals and diagrams. I cannot share the code due to security reasons and company policy.
